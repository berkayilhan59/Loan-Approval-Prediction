# Loan Approval Prediction 
After the challenging trainings of Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp, 
I had the opportunity to apply my new competencies in data science
in my capstone project “Data Hunters”. This project focused on developing a model that analyzes bank customers'
loan applications to determine which customers can be granted a loan.

As a team, we analyzed 4269 records in our dataset, specifically using important variables that affect loan approval,
such as CIBIL score. We applied Random Forest and Logistic Regression, data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models. Presenting the results using data visualization ,
Taking our project live with Streamlit and business intelligence platform Power BI made our analysis more understandable and impressive.

## Dataset History:
The bank has collected a data set on customers to whom loans have been granted in the past. Using data, the process of identifying, monitoring and 
managing potential customers who can be given loans in the future is handled. In order to automate this process, the customers who will receive loan approval
are determined.

## Dataset Problem:
If customers submit their loan information to the bank, they must meet certain criteria such as annual income, number of dependents, cibil score(credit socore)
in order to receive loan approval. If customers meet these expenses, their loan applications are approved otherwise, the loan payment is rejected.
